C:\wamp64\www\trips>php app/console generate:bundle --namespace=TestingBundle


  Welcome to the Symfony2 bundle generator



In your code, a bundle is often referenced by its name. It can be the
concatenation of all namespace parts but it's really up to you to come
up with a unique name (a good practice is to start with the vendor name).
Based on the namespace, we suggest TestingBundle.

Bundle name [TestingBundle]:

The bundle can be generated anywhere. The suggested default directory uses
the standard conventions.

Target directory [C:\wamp64\www\trips/src]: src/Trip/

Determine the format to use for the generated configuration.

Configuration format (yml, xml, php, or annotation): yml

To help you get started faster, the command can generate some
code snippets for you.

Do you want to generate the whole directory structure [no]?
